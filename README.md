## About

**KiNO Installer** is a tool to speed up either KiNO as BepInEx installation (which is a KiNO requirement).

**BepInEx here is used exclusively for KiNO MOD and won't work directly on other games.**

## Installation

1. Download and install **KiNO Installer** [here](https://github.com/pzzzl/kino-installer/raw/main/KiNO%20Installer.exe)
2. Run `KiNO Installer.exe`
3. Select `CarX Drift Racing Online` under `Steam/steamapps/common` folder
4. Wait for the program to finish it's execution
5. Your mod is up to go ðŸ˜„

## How it works?

Given the CarX directory, the program either download or update your mod with the latest files, pretty util when something is broken. Liveries, tunes or anything associated with the modifications will remain.

## Contribution

<!-- **SOON** -->
There are a few ways to contribute to this project (besides contributing to KiNO mod itself, which I highly recommend):

- Documentation about this tool (including translation).
- Contributing to the source code directly.
- If you've seen a new release of KiNO or BepInEx different from those described at the top of this documentation, you can propose a change [here](https://github.com/pzzzl/kino-installer/blob/main/version/latest.json).
