## About

**KiNO Installer** is a tool to speed up either <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/KiNO-v2.6.1-orange"> as <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/BepInEx-v5.4.15-brightgreen"> installation (which is a KiNO requirement). This installer is updated on every version of one of these two softwares. If you see the <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-outdated-red"> badge at the top of this documentation, one of these two softwares aren't at their latest version in this installer.

**BepInEx here is used exclusively for KiNO MOD and won't work directly on other games.**

## Installation

1. Download and install **KiNO Installer** [here](https://github.com/pzzzl/kino-installer/raw/main/KiNO%20Installer.exe)
2. Run `KiNO Installer.exe`
3. Select `CarX Drift Racing Online` under `Steam/steamapps/common` folder
4. Wait for the program to finish it's execution
5. Your mod is up to go ðŸ˜„

## How it works?

KiNO Installer was developed using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9.6-lightyellow">. Given the CarX directory, the program either download or update your mod with the last files, pretty util when something is broken. Liveries, tunes or anything associated with the modifications will remain.
